# Qubit Playground

Qubit playground is a web app that simulates one or two qubits at a time. You can interact with these qubits using one of many quantum gates.

# One Qubit Mode

By default, the website loads into one qubit mode. In this mode, you can apply the following one qubit gates:
- Pauli-X
- Pauli-Y
- Pauli-Z
- Hadamard
- Phase
- PI/8 (T)
